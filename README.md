# QC3001 â€“ Artificial Intelligence (2025â€“2026)

This repository contains my **Year 3, Semester 1** tutorial work for **QC3001: Artificial Intelligence**, completed on **Google Colab** and synced with **GitHub** for version control.

Throughout this module, weâ€™ll explore the core principles and algorithms that form the foundation of Artificial Intelligence, while implementing and experimenting with them in **Python**.
